# Todoist MCP

Connect this [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server to your LLM to interact with Todoist.

## Functionality

This integration implements all the APIs available from the [Todoist TypeScript Client](https://doist.github.io/todoist-api-typescript/api/classes/TodoistApi/), providing access to:

### Task Management
- Create tasks (with content, descriptions, due dates, priorities, labels, and more)
- Create tasks with natural language (e.g., "Submit report by Friday 5pm #Work")
- Retrieve tasks (individual, filtered, or all tasks)
- Retrieve completed tasks (by completion date or due date)
- Get productivity statistics
- Update tasks
- Move tasks (individually or in batches)
- Close/reopen tasks
- Delete tasks

### Project Management
- Create, retrieve, update, and delete projects

### Section Management
- Create, retrieve, update, and delete sections within projects

### Comment Management
- Add, retrieve, update, and delete comments for tasks or projects

### Label Management
- Create, retrieve, update, and delete labels
- Manage shared labels

### Collaboration
- Get collaborators for projects

## Setup

**Build the server app:**

```
npm install
npm run build
```

**Configure Claude:**

You must install the [Claude](https://claude.ai/) desktop app which supports MCP.

You can get your Todoist API key from [Todoist > Settings > Integrations > Developer](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer).

Then, in your `claude_desktop_config.json`, add a new MCP server:

```
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "todoist-mcp": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["/path/to/repo/build/index.js"],
            "env": {
                "TODOIST_API_KEY": "your_todoist_api_key"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can now launch Claude desktop app and ask to update Todoist.
